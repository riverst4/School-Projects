I am considering a given vibrating string equation subject to boundary conditions and intitial conditions. In order to solve the vibrating string equation with these conditions, I must use the separation of varaibles method. This entails that I must clearly state the ordinary differential equation for the time part and the Sturm-Liouville
eigenvalue problem for the space part that you need to solve. Also, to prove that the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem for the space part does not have nonpositive eigenvalues.  Lastly, I have to state the natural modes of vibration for the string as well as writing the solution as an infinite series.

This equaation can be interpreted as a mathematical model of vibrations of a longer string whose endpoints are fixed and the end parts of this longer string are rigid (soaked in superglue). Assume that the initial shape of the flexible part of the longer string is given by a given function. Based off this knowledge I have to find the equation for the initial shape of the entire string.Once all of these steps are completed I have the correct tools to illustrate an animated version of a vibrating string.
