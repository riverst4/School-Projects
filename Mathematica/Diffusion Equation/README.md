   I am considering a one-dimensional diffusion of dye in a narrow glass tube of length Ï€. Then let the environment substance be uniform throughout the tube and let all the relevant diffusion constants be equal to one. Assume that all the lateral sides as well as the endpoints of the tube are insulated, so that no dye leaves the tube. This situation is modeled by the following partial differential equation with the boundary and initial conditions. The steps needed to achieve this, are to express the solution of the given differential equation (with the boundary conditions and initial conditions) as an infinite series. Once this is achieved, what's needed is to find the solution of the diffusion of the dye problem if the distribution of dye is given by any given function (in this case, it is f(x) = (sin(x))^8).
