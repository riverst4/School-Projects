My group partner and I were tasked with producing a game called 'Deadwood' using object oriented design concepts. Since this was a massive project, we closely analyzed the requirments of the game by creating use cases, sequence diagrams, UML class diagrams, and crc cards. This greatly minimized the amount of time that wouldd've been spent debugging (as we had a very strong outline and foundation).

The Deadwood board game about actors, acting, and the life of a wandering bit player. It’s ideal for two to six players, and is decent with 7 or 8. The total play time is about 60 minutes. For extra credit we were able to implement a bot for a single person to play with in case only one person wanted to play. The game lasts for four “days”. The objective of the game is to score the most points at the end.
